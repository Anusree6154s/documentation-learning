## Answers
Here are concise answers to each question with code examples:

---

### 1. What is NestJS, and how is it different from Express.js?  
NestJS is a framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express.js or Fastify, providing an abstraction with more features. While Express.js is minimal and flexible, NestJS uses TypeScript, promotes the use of decorators, and follows SOLID principles to enhance scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity. It integrates well with TypeORM, GraphQL, and WebSockets.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
// NestJS app with Express adapter
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

---

### 2. What are the main features of NestJS?  
NestJS provides robust features like **dependency injection**, **modular architecture**, **easy testing**, **asynchronous programming** with **RxJS**, and support for various databases (TypeORM, Mongoose). It offers **middleware**, **guards**, **interceptors**, and **pipes** for handling requests efficiently. It also integrates with WebSockets, GraphQL, and microservices, making it suitable for large-scale applications. The framework uses **TypeScript** by default, enabling type safety and better code structure.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

### 3. Explain the role of a **module** in NestJS.  
In NestJS, a **module** is a container for related components such as services, controllers, and providers. Modules encapsulate functionality and allow for a clean, organized structure. Each application must have at least one module (usually `AppModule`). Modules help with dependency injection and can import other modules to access their functionality.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule], // Importing other modules
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

### 4. What is a **controller** in NestJS, and how does it work?  
A **controller** in NestJS handles incoming HTTP requests and returns responses. It defines the routes and their respective request handlers (methods). Controllers are decorated with the `@Controller()` decorator and map HTTP methods (`@Get()`, `@Post()`, etc.) to functions. Controllers receive inputs via method parameters and return outputs as responses.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return this.usersService.findAll();
  }
}
```

---

### 5. How do you define a **service** in NestJS?  
A **service** in NestJS contains business logic and is injected into controllers or other services using dependency injection. Services are decorated with `@Injectable()` and are designed to handle tasks such as interacting with databases or external APIs. They help keep controllers focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  findAll(): string {
    return 'This action returns all users';
  }
}
```

---

### 6. How does **dependency injection** work in NestJS?  
**Dependency Injection (DI)** in NestJS allows services, controllers, or other classes to be injected automatically into constructors. NestJS uses an **IoC container** (Inversion of Control) to manage the lifecycle of services. The container resolves dependencies at runtime, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(private readonly usersRepository: UsersRepository) {}
  // Service logic
}
```

---

### 7. What is the difference between a **singleton service** and a **scoped service**?  
A **singleton service** is instantiated once and shared across the entire application, ensuring a single instance is used throughout. A **scoped service**, on the other hand, creates a new instance per request, providing a fresh instance for each HTTP request. Scoped services are useful for managing per-request state.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST }) // Scoped service
export class UsersService {}
```

---

### 8. How do you create and use **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** in NestJS?  
DTOs in NestJS are objects that define the shape of data transferred between the client and the server. They are typically used to validate and transform data in request bodies. **Pipes** can be applied to DTOs for validation.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
export class CreateUserDto {
  @IsString()
  name: string;

  @IsInt()
  age: number;
}
```

---

### 9. How can you set up **middleware** in a NestJS application?  
**Middleware** in NestJS is used to process incoming requests before they reach the route handler. You can define middleware using the `@Middleware()` decorator or by applying it globally or per route.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    console.log('Request...', req.url);
    next();
  }
}
```

---

### 10. How do you define and use **guards** in NestJS?  
**Guards** in NestJS determine whether a request should be processed based on certain conditions (e.g., authentication). Guards are implemented by implementing the `CanActivate` interface and are applied using the `@UseGuards()` decorator.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return Boolean(request.user); // Guard logic
  }
}
```
