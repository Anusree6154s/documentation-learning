## 🖊️ Code Editors in Programming

### 🔹 Two main types

* **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** → project-level, feature-rich.
* **Lightweight editors** → fast, simple, file-level.
* Many developers use **both** (IDE + lightweight editor).

### 🔹 IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

* Works on **whole project** (not just single files).
* Features:

  * File navigation across project.
  * Autocompletion (based on entire project).
  * Git/version control integration.
  * Testing tools & project-level features.
* Examples:

  * **Visual Studio Code** → cross-platform, free.
  * **WebStorm** → cross-platform, paid.
  * **Visual Studio (not VS Code!)** → Windows-only, powerful for .NET, also good for JS.

    * Paid, but has free **Community Edition**.
* Note: Paid IDEs often have free trials → cost is small compared to dev salary.

### 🔹 Lightweight Editors

* **Fast & simple** → best for opening/editing single files quickly.
* Differences from IDE:

  * IDE = project-level, slower startup, deeper analysis.
  * Lightweight = instant, minimal setup.
* Can be extended with plugins (blurring line between IDE & lightweight).
* Examples:

  * **Sublime Text** → cross-platform, shareware.
  * **Notepad++** → Windows, free.
  * **Vim** / **Emacs** → very powerful if you master them.

### 🔹 Choosing an Editor

* Depends on **projects, habits, and personal preference**.
* Author’s recommendation:

  * **Frontend-heavy devs** → Visual Studio Code.
  * **Other platforms/languages + some frontend** → consider specialized IDEs like:

    * **XCode** (Mac).
    * **Visual Studio** (Windows).
    * **JetBrains IDEs** → WebStorm, PHPStorm, RubyMine, etc.
