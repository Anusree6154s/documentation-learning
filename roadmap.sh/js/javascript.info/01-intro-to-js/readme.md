## 🔹 Introduction to JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?

* Created to **make web pages interactive (“alive”)**.
* Programs are called **scripts**, can run inside HTML pages.
* Executed as **plain text**, no compilation required.
* Different from **Java** (despite the name).

<br>

### Why is it called JavaScript?

* Originally named **LiveScript**.
* Renamed during Java’s popularity → marketed as Java’s “younger brother”.
* Now fully independent, based on **ECMAScript specification**.

<br>

### Where does JavaScript run?

* **In browsers** (default).
* **On servers** (Node.js).
* **On devices** with JavaScript engines.

📌 Browser engines:

* **V8** → Chrome, Opera, Edge.
* **SpiderMonkey** → Firefox.
* **Chakra** → Internet Explorer.
* **JavaScriptCore / Nitro / SquirrelFish** → Safari.

<br>

### How do JS engines work?

1. Parse script → read the code.
2. Compile script → convert to machine code.
3. Execute machine code (with optimizations).
4. Continuously optimize during execution.

<br>

### ✅ What can in-browser JavaScript do?

* Manipulate **HTML/CSS** (add/change/remove content, styles).
* React to **user actions** (clicks, keypress, pointer).
* **Send/receive data** from servers (AJAX, fetch, websockets).
* Work with **cookies, local storage, session storage**.
* Show **alerts, prompts, confirmations**.

<br>

### ❌ What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?

* Direct **file system access** (read/write arbitrary files).
* Direct **OS-level access** (run programs, manage memory/CPU).
* Use camera/microphone **without permission**.
* Access data from **other sites/tabs** (due to **Same Origin Policy**).
* Bypass **CORS restrictions** without server consent.

<br>

### What makes JavaScript unique?

1. **Full integration with HTML/CSS**.
2. **Simplicity** → easy to learn & use.
3. **Universal support** → works in all browsers, enabled by default.

<br>

### Languages built “on top of” JavaScript

* **CoffeeScript** → shorter, cleaner syntax.
* **TypeScript** → adds strict typing (Microsoft).
* **Flow** → typing system (Facebook).
* **Dart** → standalone + can compile to JS (Google).
* **Brython** → write Python that runs as JS.
* **Kotlin** → concise, modern language that can target JS.

<br>

### Summary

* JavaScript → **born as browser language**, now **runs everywhere**.
* Remains **the only language natively supported by all browsers**.
* Many transpiled languages exist, but **knowing JS is essential**.
