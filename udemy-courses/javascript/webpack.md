### **Webpack Setup and Bundling Process Summary**

1. **Goal:**
   - The goal is to combine multiple JavaScript files into a single, bundled file for efficient loading, preventing unnecessary HTTP requests.

2. **Introduction to Webpack:**
   - **Webpack** is a bundling tool that can also manage build workflows. The primary focus here is to bundle code into a single file.
   - Webpack helps orchestrate dependencies and organizes code for production.

3. **Installation:**
   - Install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as development dependencies using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
     ```

4. **Webpack Configuration:**
   - Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory. This is where we define the bundling configuration.
   - Use **Node.js `module.exports`** to expose the configuration object.
   - In the configuration, specify:
     - **Entry file** (`app.js`): The starting point of the app.
     - **Output file**: Where the bundled file will be saved (in the `assets/scripts` folder).

5. **Folder Structure:**
   - Move source code into a `src` folder to separate source files from output files.
   - The `src` folder contains individual files like `app.js`, `utility`, etc., while the bundled output will go into the `assets/scripts` folder.

6. **Basic Webpack Setup:**
   - In `webpack.config.js`, define the entry point (`app.js`), and output location (use `path.resolve` for absolute paths):
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     module.exports = {
       entry: './src/app.js',
       output: {
         filename: 'app.js',
         path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets', 'scripts')
       }
     };
     ```

7. **NPM Script for Webpack:**
   - Add a script in `package.json` to run webpack:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "build": "webpack"
     }
     ```
   - Run the build process using `npm run build`.

8. **Initial Errors:**
   - Errors related to:
     - **Unsupported syntax**: Webpack couldn't process newer syntax (e.g., class fields in `project-list`).
     - **Missing extensions**: Webpack does not require `.js` extensions in imports, unlike browser-based code.

9. **Fixes:**
   - **Remove unsupported syntax**: Replace class field syntax with traditional object properties in classes.
   - **Remove `.js` extensions**: Remove file extensions from import paths in all files (`app.js`, `tooltip.js`, etc.).

10. **Final Output:**
   - After fixing issues, run the build again (`npm run build`).
   - Webpack creates the bundled output, with two files:
     - A main `app.js` file and a `1.app.js` file for **lazy loading** (only loads the tooltip code when required).
   - Webpack’s default production mode optimizes the code (minifies and reduces file size).

11. **Result:**
   - The output consists of optimized and bundled JavaScript files, with efficient loading via lazy loading and dependency management.

### **Bonus: Multiple Entry Points in Webpack**

1. **When to Use Multiple Entry Points:**
   - In larger projects with multiple HTML pages, you might need different scripts for each page.
   - Instead of having a single entry point (e.g., `app.js`), you can specify multiple entry points to generate separate bundles for different HTML pages.

2. **How to Configure Multiple Entry Points:**
   - In the `webpack.config.js` file, you can specify multiple entry points like this:
     ```javascript
     entry: {
         welcome: './src/welcome-page/welcome.js',
         about: './src/about-page/about.js',
         // additional pages/scripts as needed
     }
     ```
   - This configuration tells Webpack to generate separate bundles for each entry point (e.g., `welcome.js`, `about.js`).

3. **Best Practice:**
   - **One entry point per HTML file**: This is a common rule because each HTML page typically requires a unique script.
   - However, if a script is shared across multiple pages or if a page doesn't need a script, you can adjust this rule accordingly.

4. **Useful Resources:**
   - **Code Splitting (Multiple Bundles)**: [Webpack Code Splitting Guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
   - **Entry Point Configuration**: [Webpack Entry Point Concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry)
   - **Official Webpack Documentation**: [Webpack Docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/)

This setup allows you to create optimized, page-specific bundles for efficient loading and improved performance.

### **Webpack Development Build and Fixing Path Issues**

1. **Webpack Default Mode:**
   - By default, Webpack uses **production mode**, which applies optimizations.
   - In development, you typically don't want these optimizations, so you need to explicitly set the mode to **development**.

2. **Setting Webpack Mode:**
   - In `webpack.config.js`, add the `mode` key and set it to `development`:
     ```javascript
     mode: 'development'
     ```
   - After this change, running `npm run build` will produce an unoptimized bundle, which is easier to debug.

3. **Checking the Output:**
   - In development mode, Webpack produces larger, unoptimized files. You’ll see `0.app.js` and `1.app.js`, for example, as separate files instead of a single optimized one.
   - The application works correctly with **app.js**, but the issue arises when trying to load additional files like **0.app.js**.

4. **Path Issue with Dynamic Bundles:**
   - The issue is that **0.app.js** is being loaded from the wrong path (root instead of `assets/scripts/`).
   - This needs to be fixed by setting the **public path** in the Webpack configuration.

5. **Fixing the Path Issue:**
   - In `webpack.config.js`, under the `output` section, set the `publicPath` to ensure the dynamically loaded files are correctly referenced:
     ```javascript
     output: {
         publicPath: 'assets/scripts/',
     }
     ```
   - This tells Webpack to load the dynamically split bundles from the correct folder.

6. **Final Steps:**
   - After updating the configuration, stop the development server (`Ctrl + C`), run `npm run build` again, and restart the server with `serve`.
   - Now, when you reload the application, the dynamically loaded bundles (like **0.app.js**) will be found and loaded correctly.

This ensures your application can dynamically load JavaScript files on-demand while using bundled outputs in development mode.

### **Debugging with Webpack and Setting Up for Production**

1. **Debugging in Development Mode:**
   - In development, Webpack produces bundled code that is hard to debug. To improve debugging:
     - The **Sources** tab in the browser's developer tools will show the Webpack-generated code, which is difficult to debug.
     - Webpack also provides an option to map your code back to the original files to improve the debugging experience.

2. **Adding Source Maps:**
   - To enable better debugging, you need to configure Webpack to use **source maps**, which link the bundled code back to the original source code.
   - In the `webpack.config.js` file, add the `devtool` property with a source map option:
     ```javascript
     devtool: 'cheap-module-eval-source-map'
     ```
   - This setting improves the mapping between the bundled code and the original code, making debugging easier.

3. **Choosing the Right Devtool:**
   - Webpack offers various **devtool** options with different levels of detail and performance trade-offs. 
   - For development, you want a good balance between debugging quality and performance. The **`cheap-module-eval-source-map`** option is a good choice for this.

4. **Restarting the Build Process:**
   - After adding the `devtool` configuration, restart your development server to apply the changes.
   
5. **Debugging with Improved Setup:**
   - After restarting, open your project in the browser and inspect the **webpack** folder in the **Source** tab.
   - You should now see your original code files (even if they're tweaked by Webpack).
   - You can set breakpoints in these original files (e.g., in `project list`) and debug normally.

6. **Complete Development Experience:**
   - With **linting**, **Webpack bundling**, **development server**, and now a **good debugging setup**, you're all set for a smooth development workflow.
   
7. **Next Steps:**
   - The next step is to focus on **production optimization**, ensuring your code is minimized and optimized for production builds.

This sets up a solid development environment with proper debugging, ready for further optimization for production.

### **Two Improvements for Production Build**

1. **Cleaning the Output Folder:**

   - **Issue**: The `assets/scripts` folder grows over time with old, unused files when new builds are created.
   - **Solution**: Use the `clean-webpack-plugin` to automatically clean the output folder before each new build.

   **Install with**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin
   ```

   **In the Webpack config**, import and add `clean-webpack-plugin` to the `plugins` array.

   ```js
   const path = require('path');
   const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin'); // Import the plugin

   module.exports = {
     entry: './src/index.js',
     output: {
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets/scripts'),
       filename: 'bundle.js'
     },
     plugins: [
       new CleanWebpackPlugin(),  // Add the CleanWebpackPlugin to clean the output folder
     ],
     mode: 'production', // Production mode for optimized code
   };
   ```

   This ensures that the output folder only contains the necessary files for the current build.

   Both the **development** and **production** config files should include this plugin.

2. **Dynamic File Names for Cache Busting:**

   - **Issue**: Browsers cache JavaScript and CSS files, which can cause them to serve outdated files unless the cache is cleared.
   - **Solution**: Add a dynamic element to the output file names (a unique hash) to ensure that browsers download the latest version of the files after a build.

   **Modify the production Webpack config's** output file name to include `[contenthash]`, which generates a unique hash based on the file content.

   ```js
   const path = require('path');
   const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin'); // Import the plugin

   module.exports = {
     entry: './src/index.js',
     output: {
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets/scripts'),
       filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',  // Add contenthash to the filename
     },
     plugins: [
       new CleanWebpackPlugin(),  // Clean the output folder
     ],
     mode: 'production', // Production mode for optimized code
   };
   ```

   This way, file names change whenever the content changes, ensuring that browsers always download the latest version.

   After building for production, update the `index.html` file to reference the new hashed file names.

   Example of how to reference the new hashed file in `index.html`:

   ```html
   <script src="assets/scripts/bundle.abc123.js"></script>
   ```



### **Outcome**:

- The `clean-webpack-plugin` ensures that only the necessary files are in the output folder.
- Dynamic file names ensure browsers always fetch the latest version of assets by forcing cache invalidation when the file content changes.

### Summary: Adding Third-Party Libraries with npm and Webpack

In this bonus section, we enhanced the project by adding third-party libraries, using **npm** and **Webpack** to manage dependencies and bundle our code.

1. **Installing Libraries via npm**:
   - To add a library like **Lodash**, use the `npm install` (or `npm i`) command:
     ```
     npm i lodash
     ```
   - This installs the library into the `node_modules` folder and adds it to the **dependencies** section of `package.json`.

2. **Using the Installed Library**:
   - To use **Lodash** (or any third-party package) in your project, you import it in your JavaScript file, e.g., `app.js`:
     ```js
     import _ from 'lodash';
     ```
   - This tells **Webpack** to find the package in `node_modules` and include it in the bundle.

3. **Optimizing Imports**:
   - By default, importing `lodash` imports the entire package. However, you can optimize by only importing the specific parts of **Lodash** that you need (e.g., `lodash/array` for array functions).
   - This helps to reduce the final bundle size, as only the required parts of the library are included.

4. **Using the Library in the Application**:
   - Once **Lodash** is imported, you can use it in your code (e.g., `_.difference([0, 1], [1, 2])`).
   - When you run `npm run build:dev`, **Webpack** will bundle **Lodash** with your project, and the code will work in the browser when you reload the page.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Always refer to the official documentation for third-party libraries to understand how to properly import and use them in your project.

This approach simplifies dependency management, optimizes bundles, and integrates third-party packages effectively into your Webpack-based project.
