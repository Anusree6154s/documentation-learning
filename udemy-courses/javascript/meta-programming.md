### Summary: Understanding Symbols in JavaScript

Symbols are a primitive data type in JavaScript, similar to strings and numbers, but with unique properties.

1. **What are Symbols?**  
   - Symbols are primitive values that are **unique**. Each symbol created is distinct, ensuring no accidental collisions or overrides of property names in objects.
   - They can be used as **object property keys** just like strings or numbers, but the key will be unique.

2. **Creating Symbols**:
   - You create a symbol using the `Symbol()` function:
     ```js
     const uid = Symbol('uid');
     ```
   - The string passed to the `Symbol()` function is just an identifier for developers and doesn't affect the symbol's uniqueness.

3. **Use Case in Objects**:
   - Symbols are useful in scenarios where you want to ensure certain object properties are not accidentally modified or overridden. For example, when building a library, you might want to ensure that an object property (like an `ID`) cannot be changed by the library user.
   - In the library, you would use a symbol as the key:
     ```js
     const user = {
       [uid]: 'p1',
       name: 'Max',
       age: 30,
     };
     ```
   - Here, the `uid` symbol is used as a key for the ID, ensuring it cannot be overwritten or accessed by the library user.

4. **Symbol's Uniqueness**:
   - Even if the user tries to access or override the symbol property, it won't affect the original symbol:
     ```js
     user[uid] = 'p2'; // Won't change the internal symbol value.
     console.log(user[uid]); // Still 'p1'.
     ```
   - If a new symbol is created with the same identifier, it is not the same symbol and accessing the property will return `undefined`:
     ```js
     const anotherSymbol = Symbol('uid');
     console.log(user[anotherSymbol]); // undefined
     ```
   - Symbols ensure that the keys they represent are unique and isolated to the library or code that created them.

5. **Practical Use**:
   - Symbols are especially useful for creating private properties or unique keys in libraries to prevent conflicts and ensure integrity.
   - While you can add identifiers for debugging purposes, you don't need to. The symbol itself guarantees uniqueness without needing a specific identifier.

In summary, symbols offer a powerful way to create unique, non-overridable keys for objects, making them useful for libraries or situations where property names need to remain safe from external modification.
