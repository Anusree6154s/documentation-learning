Here’s a **structured breakdown** of the **fast-forward merge in Git**, including the **order of commands, purpose, and results**.

---

## **Fast-Forward Merge: Order of Commands, Purpose & Results**

### **1. Create a Master Branch (Default)**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git init
  ```
- **Purpose:** Initialize a new Git repository.
- **Result:** A `.git` folder is created, and `master` is set as the default branch.

  git add index.html
  git commit -m "Initial commit with index.html"
  ```
- **Purpose:** Create and commit an initial file in `master`.
- **Result:** `index.html` is tracked and committed in `master`.

---

### **3. Create a Feature Branch**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git checkout -b feature
  ```
- **Purpose:** Create a new branch (`feature`) from `master`.
- **Result:** The new branch `feature` has the same commit history as `master`.

---

### **4. Add Changes to the Feature Branch**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  touch feature.js
  git add feature.js
  git commit -m "Added feature.js"
  
  echo "console.log('Feature added');" >> feature.js
  git add feature.js
  git commit -m "Updated feature.js"
  ```
- **Purpose:** Add and commit changes specific to `feature`.
- **Result:** The `feature` branch has two additional commits.

---

### **5. Ensure Master Has No New Commits**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git checkout master
  git log --oneline
  ```
- **Purpose:** Verify that `master` has no new commits since `feature` was created.
- **Result:** The last commit in `master` matches the point where `feature` was created.

---

### **6. Merge Feature Branch into Master (Fast-Forward)**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git merge feature
  ```
- **Purpose:** Merge `feature` branch into `master`.
- **Result:** 
  - **Fast-Forward Merge Happens:** 
    - Since `master` has no new commits, `HEAD` simply moves forward to include all `feature` branch commits.
    - No additional "merge commit" is created.

---

### **7. Delete Feature Branch (Optional)**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git branch -d feature
  ```
- **Purpose:** Remove the `feature` branch after merging.
- **Result:** The `feature` branch is deleted, but its commits remain in `master`.

| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Result** |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| `git init` | Initialize a Git repository | Creates a `.git` folder |
| `git checkout -b feature` | Create and switch to the `feature` branch | New `feature` branch created |
| `git commit -m "Message"` | Commit changes | Saves progress in `feature` |
| `git checkout master` | Switch back to `master` | Prepares for merging |
| `git merge feature` | Merge `feature` into `master` | Moves `HEAD` forward (Fast-Forward Merge) |
| `git branch -d feature` | Delete the `feature` branch | Removes `feature`, commits remain in `master` |

---

## **Key Takeaways of Fast-Forward Merge**
✅ **No new merge commit is created.**  
✅ **Master simply "fast-forwards" to the latest commit in `feature`.**  
✅ **Only works if `master` hasn’t changed since the branch was created.**

Here’s a structured breakdown of the **Fast-Forward Merge and Squash Merge** in Git, including the **commands, their purpose, and the results**.

---

## **Fast-Forward Merge & Squash Merge: Order of Commands, Purpose & Results**

### **1. Initialize Git Repository**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git init
  ```
- **Purpose:** Initialize a new Git repository.
- **Result:** Creates a `.git` folder and sets `master` as the default branch.

---

### **2. Create the Master Branch and Add Initial Commits**
- **Commands:**
  ```sh
  mkdir master
  touch master/master1.txt
  git add master
  git commit -m "m1 - Initial commit in master"

  touch master/master2.txt
  git add master
  git commit -m "m2 - Second commit in master"
  ```
- **Purpose:** Create the `master` folder, add two commits (`m1` and `m2`) to the `master` branch.
- **Result:** `master` branch has two commits.

---

### **3. Create a Feature Branch**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git switch -c feature
  ```
  *(or `git checkout -b feature` in older versions)*
- **Purpose:** Create a new branch `feature` from `master`.
- **Result:** `feature` starts from the same commit history as `master`.

---

### **4. Add Changes to the Feature Branch**
- **Commands:**
  ```sh
  mkdir feature
  touch feature/f1.txt
  git add feature
  git commit -m "f1 - First commit in feature"

  touch feature/f2.txt
  git add feature
  git commit -m "f2 - Second commit in feature"
  ```
- **Purpose:** Add two commits (`f1` and `f2`) to `feature`.
- **Result:** `feature` branch now has two additional commits.

---

### **5. Verify Branch State**
- **Commands:**
  ```sh
  git branch
  git log --oneline --graph --all
  ```
- **Purpose:** Ensure `master` has no new commits and verify `feature` has `f1` and `f2` commits.
- **Result:** `feature` and `master` have diverged.

---

### **6. Switch to Master Branch**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git switch master
  ```
- **Purpose:** Move back to `master` before merging.
- **Result:** `HEAD` points to `master`.

---

### **7. Perform a Fast-Forward Merge**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git merge feature
  ```
- **Purpose:** Merge `feature` into `master` with a **fast-forward merge**.
- **Result:** `master` moves its pointer forward to include `f1` and `f2`, **without creating a new merge commit**.

---

### **8. Undo Fast-Forward Merge (if needed)**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git reset --hard HEAD~2
  ```
- **Purpose:** Undo the last two commits (f1 and f2) from `master` and return to `m2`.
- **Result:** `master` reverts to before the merge.

---

### **9. Perform a Squash Merge (Alternative)**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git merge --squash feature
  ```
- **Purpose:** Combine all commits in `feature` into a single commit before merging.
- **Result:** Changes are staged but **not yet committed**.

---

### **10. Create the Squash Commit**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Merged feature into master as a single commit"
  ```
- **Purpose:** Finalize the squash merge with a single commit.
- **Result:** `master` has only **one new commit** representing all feature changes.

---

### **11. Undo Squash Merge (if needed)**
- **Command:**
  ```sh
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```
- **Purpose:** Remove the last squash commit from `master`.
- **Result:** `master` reverts to before the merge.

---

### **Summary Table**
| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Result** |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| `git init` | Initialize a Git repository | Creates a `.git` folder |
| `git switch -c feature` | Create a `feature` branch | `feature` starts from `master` |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commit changes | Saves progress in `feature` |
| `git switch master` | Switch back to `master` | Prepares for merging |
| `git merge feature` | Merge `feature` into `master` | **Fast-Forward Merge** (HEAD moves forward) |
| `git merge --squash feature` | Merge `feature` into a **single commit** | Squashed changes are staged, but not committed |
| `git commit -m "Merged feature"` | Finalize Squash Merge | Only one new commit in `master` |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~2` | Undo Fast-Forward Merge | Removes `feature` commits from `master` |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Undo Squash Merge | Removes the squash commit |

---

## **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Fast-Forward Merge**
- Occurs when `master` has **no new commits** since branching.
- **No new merge commit** is created—just moves `HEAD` forward.

✅ **Squash Merge**
- Combines all commits into **one** before merging.
- Useful for keeping commit history clean.

- **Purpose:** Creates a `master` folder, adds a `master1.txt` file, and commits it.
- **Result:** First commit (`m1`) is stored.

```sh
touch master/master2.txt
git add .
git commit -m "m2"
```
- **Purpose:** Adds `master2.txt` and commits it.

- **Result:** A new **merge commit** appears in the history.

---

## **10. Undoing the Recursive Merge**
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
- **Purpose:** Moves `master` branch pointer back by one commit.
- **Result:** Removes the merge commit, restoring `master` to its previous state.

---

## **11. Creating a New Commit in Master**
```sh
touch master/m3.txt
git add .
git commit -m "m3"
```
- **Purpose:** Adds a new commit (`m3`) in `master` after feature branch was created.
- **Result:** `master` now has an additional commit.

---

## **12. Merging When Both Branches Have New Commits (Recursive Merge)**
```sh
git merge feature
```
- **Purpose:** Merges `feature` into `master` when both branches have unique commits.
- **Result:** **Recursive merge** occurs, creating a **merge commit**.

---

## **13. Undoing the Recursive Merge**
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
- **Purpose:** Moves `master` branch pointer back by one commit.
- **Result:** Removes the merge commit.

---

## **14. Squashing Merge with Changes in Both Branches**
```sh
git merge --squash feature
git commit -m "Merged master and feature"
```
- **Purpose:** Combines all `feature` changes into a **single commit** before merging.
- **Result:** Merge commit contains a **clean history** without separate `feature` commits.

---

## **Summary of Merging Strategies**
| **Merge Type**  | **Command Used** | **Result** |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Fast-Forward Merge** | `git merge feature` | Moves `master` pointer forward to `feature`'s latest commit. No new commit created. |
| **Undo Fast-Forward Merge** | `git reset --hard HEAD~2` | Moves `master` back before merging. |
| **Squash Merge** | `git merge --squash feature` → `git commit -m "message"` | Combines all feature commits into one before merging. |
| **Undo Squash Merge** | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Moves `master` back before squash merge. |
| **Non-Fast-Forward Merge (Recursive Merge)** | `git merge --no-ff feature` | Creates a **merge commit** even if fast-forward was possible. |
| **Undo Recursive Merge** | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Removes the merge commit. |
| **Recursive Merge (when both branches have changes)** | `git merge feature` | Automatically uses **recursive merge** when both branches have unique commits. |
| **Squash Merge with Changes in Both Branches** | `git merge --squash feature` → `git commit -m "message"` | Squashes all feature changes into a single commit. |

This breakdown covers all commands in order, their purpose, and what each results in. Let me know if you need more details! 🚀

Here’s a structured breakdown of the **Git rebase** workflow, including the order of commands, their purpose, and the results.  

---

### **1. Initializing and Setting Up the Project**
```sh
git init
```
- **Purpose:** Initializes a new Git repository.
- **Result:** Creates a `.git` directory to track changes.

---

### **2. Creating and Committing in the Master Branch**
```sh
mkdir master
touch master/master1.txt
git add .
git commit -m "m1"
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a `master` folder, adds `master1.txt`, and commits it.
- **Result:** First commit (`m1`) in the `master` branch.

```sh
touch master/master2.txt
git add .
git commit -m "m2"
```
- **Purpose:** Adds `master2.txt` and commits it.
- **Result:** Second commit (`m2`) in `master`.

---

### **3. Creating and Switching to Feature Branch**
```sh
git switch -c feature
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a new branch `feature` and switches to it.
- **Result:** Now working in the `feature` branch.

---

### **4. Creating and Committing in the Feature Branch**
```sh
mkdir feature
touch feature/f1.txt
git add .
git commit -m "f1"
```
- **Purpose:** Creates `feature` folder, adds `f1.txt`, and commits it.
- **Result:** First commit (`f1`) in `feature`.

```sh
touch feature/f2.txt
git add .
git commit -m "f2"
```
- **Purpose:** Adds `f2.txt` and commits it.
- **Result:** Second commit (`f2`) in `feature`.

---

### **5. Adding a New Commit in Master**
```sh
git switch master
touch master/m3.txt
git add .
git commit -m "m3"
```
- **Purpose:** Adds a new commit (`m3`) in `master` after feature branch was created.
- **Result:** `master` now has an additional commit.

---

### **6. Rebasing the Feature Branch onto the Updated Master**
```sh
git switch feature
git rebase master
```
- **Purpose:** Moves the `feature` branch commits (`f1`, `f2`) on top of the latest `master` commit (`m3`).
- **Result:**
  - The base commit for `feature` changes from `m2` to `m3`.
  - **New commits** are created for `f1` and `f2` with new hashes.
  - The commit history becomes linear.

---

### **7. Merging the Rebased Feature Branch into Master**
```sh
git switch master
git merge feature
```
- **Purpose:** Merges the **rebased** `feature` branch into `master`.
- **Result:** 
  - Since `feature` was rebased, a **fast-forward merge** occurs.
  - The merge commit is **avoided**, keeping history clean.

---

### **8. Undoing the Rebase**
If rebase causes issues, you can reset the branch:
```sh
git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
```
- **Purpose:** Resets the branch back to its original state before rebase.
- **Result:** The branch returns to its previous commit structure.

---

## **Summary of Rebase Workflow**
| **Step** | **Command Used** | **Result** |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Rebasing Feature Branch** | `git rebase master` | Moves `feature` commits (`f1`, `f2`) on top of `m3`, changing their commit hashes. |
| **Merging After Rebase** | `git merge feature` | Performs a **fast-forward merge**, avoiding an extra merge commit. |
| **Undoing Rebase** | `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` | Resets the branch to its state before rebase. |

---

## **Key Takeaways About Rebase**
- **Rebase rewrites history** by creating **new** commits for `f1` and `f2`.
- **Commits get new hashes**, but content remains unchanged.
- **Avoid rebasing public commits** because it can cause conflicts for others.
- **Keeps history clean** by avoiding extra merge commits.

This is the complete breakdown of the **Git rebase** process. Let me know if you need more details! 🚀

Here's a structured breakdown of the **Git rebase and fast-forward merge workflow**, including the **order of commands**, their **purpose**, and the **results**.

---

## **1. Checking Existing Branches**
```sh
git branch
```
- **Purpose:** Lists all branches in the repository.

```sh
git log --oneline
```
- **Purpose:** Lists commit hashes before rebase.
- **Result:** Displays commit IDs of `f1` and `f2`.

---

## **6. Rebasing Feature Branch onto Master**
```sh
git rebase master
```
- **Purpose:** Moves feature commits (`f1`, `f2`) **on top of the latest master commit (`m3`)**.
- **Result:**
  - The feature branch now starts from `m3` instead of `m2`.
  - **New commit hashes** are generated for `f1` and `f2`, even though content remains unchanged.

---

## **7. Checking Updated Commit IDs**
```sh
git log --oneline
```
- **Purpose:** Verifies that commits `f1` and `f2` have **new hashes**.
- **Result:** Confirms that history has been rewritten.

---

## **8. Switching to Master Branch**
```sh
git switch master
```
- **Purpose:** Moves to the `master` branch.
- **Result:** The working directory now reflects the `master` branch state.

---

## **9. Merging the Rebasing Feature Branch into Master (Fast-Forward Merge)**
```sh
git merge feature
```
- **Purpose:** Merges `feature` into `master` **without creating an extra merge commit**.
- **Result:** 
  - The master branch pointer **moves forward** to `f2` in a **fast-forward merge**.
  - Keeps the **commit history clean**.

---

## **10. Verifying the Final Commit History**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
- **Purpose:** Checks the final commit structure.
- **Result:** Confirms that history is linear, with `feature` commits following `m3`.

---

## **11. Undoing the Rebase (If Necessary)**
```sh
git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
```
- **Purpose:** Restores the branch to the state **before** the rebase.
- **Result:** The repository history returns to its previous commit structure.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
| **Step** | **Command** | **Result** |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Rebasing Feature onto Master** | `git rebase master` | Moves `feature` commits (`f1`, `f2`) on top of `m3`, **rewriting commit history**. |
| **Checking Commit IDs Before/After Rebase** | `git log --oneline` | Confirms commit hash changes. |
| **Merging After Rebase** | `git merge feature` | Performs a **fast-forward merge**, avoiding an extra merge commit. |
| **Undoing Rebase (If Needed)** | `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` | Resets branch to state before rebase. |

---

## **When to Use Rebase vs. Merge**
✅ **Use Rebase When**:
- You want a **clean, linear history**.
- You need the latest `master` updates before continuing work in `feature`.

❌ **Avoid Rebase When**:
- Working on **public repositories** shared with others.
- Rewriting commits that others might have already pulled.

---

This covers **Git rebase** and **fast-forward merging** in detail! 🚀  
Let me know if you need clarification or if you want to explore **merge conflicts** next.

Here's a structured breakdown of how to handle **merge conflicts** in Git, including the **order of commands**, their **purpose**, and the **results**.

---

## **1. Checking the Current Branch**
```sh
git branch
```
- **Purpose:** Lists all branches in the repository.
- **Result:** Confirms that you are on the `master` branch.

---

## **2. Making Changes in the Master Branch**
```sh
echo "This is the change made in the master branch." > F1.txt
git add F1.txt
git commit -m "Change in master"
```
- **Purpose:** Modifies `F1.txt`, stages the changes, and commits them.
- **Result:** The `master` branch now has a new commit modifying `F1.txt`.

---

## **3. Switching to the Feature Branch**
```sh
git switch feature
```
- **Purpose:** Moves to the `feature` branch.
- **Result:** The working directory now reflects the `feature` branch state.

---

## **4. Making Conflicting Changes in the Feature Branch**
```sh
echo "I changed this in the feature branch." > F1.txt
git add F1.txt
git commit -m "Change in feature"
```
- **Purpose:** Modifies `F1.txt` in the `feature` branch with a different change.
- **Result:** The `feature` branch now has its own separate commit modifying `F1.txt`.

---

## **5. Switching Back to the Master Branch**
```sh
git switch master
```
- **Purpose:** Moves back to the `master` branch.
- **Result:** The working directory now reflects the `master` branch state.

---

## **6. Attempting to Merge Feature into Master**
```sh
git merge feature
```
- **Purpose:** Tries to merge `feature` into `master`.
- **Result:** **Merge conflict occurs** because both branches modified `F1.txt` differently.

---

## **7. Checking Merge Conflicts**
```sh
git status
```
- **Purpose:** Identifies the files that have merge conflicts.
- **Result:** Displays `F1.txt` as having conflicts.

---

## **8. Viewing the Conflict in VS Code (or any editor)**
- The conflict markers appear inside `F1.txt`:
  ```txt
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  This is the change made in the master branch.
  =======
  I changed this in the feature branch.
  >>>>>>> feature
  ```
- **Purpose:** Shows both conflicting changes.

---

## **9. Resolving the Conflict**
- **Option 1:** Accept the **current change** (master branch version).
- **Option 2:** Accept the **incoming change** (feature branch version).
- **Option 3:** Accept **both changes** (combine them manually).

---

## **10. Adding the Resolved File to Staging**
```sh
git add F1.txt
```
- **Purpose:** Marks the conflict as resolved and stages the file.
- **Result:** The conflict is resolved but not yet committed.

---

## **11. Committing the Merge**
```sh
git commit -m "Merged feature and master in F1 file"
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a commit that finalizes the merge.
- **Result:** The `feature` branch is now merged into `master`.

---

## **12. Verifying the Commit History**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
- **Purpose:** Checks the commit history.
- **Result:** Confirms that the merge commit was created.

---

## **13. Aborting the Merge (If Needed)**
```sh
git merge --abort
```
- **Purpose:** Cancels the merge and reverts to the state before `git merge`.
- **Result:** The conflict is **removed**, and the repository returns to its original state.

---

## **14. Viewing Merge Information (Optional)**
```sh
git log --merge
git diff
```
- **Purpose:** Helps analyze the conflicting commits and differences.
- **Result:** Provides detailed insights into the conflict.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
| **Step** | **Command** | **Result** |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Merge Conflict Occurs** | `git merge feature` | Conflict in `F1.txt`. |
| **Check Conflict** | `git status` | Identifies the problematic file. |
| **Resolve Conflict** | Manually edit `F1.txt` | Fixes the conflicting content. |
| **Stage the Resolved File** | `git add F1.txt` | Marks conflict as resolved. |
| **Commit the Merge** | `git commit -m "Merged feature and master in F1 file"` | Completes the merge. |
| **Abort the Merge (if needed)** | `git merge --abort` | Cancels the merge process. |

### **Cherry-Picking in Git: Order of Commands, Purpose, and Results**  

---

### **1. Recap of Merging and Rebasing**
- **Merge (`git merge <branch>`)**: Combines branches, creating a **merge commit**.  
- **Rebase (`git rebase <branch>`)**: Moves commits from one branch **on top of another**, changing commit history and **creating new commit IDs**.  
- **Cherry-Pick (`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`)**: Copies a **specific commit** from one branch and applies it to another, **without merging the whole branch**.

---

## **2. Practical Example of Cherry-Picking**
### **Step 1: Checking the Current Branch**
```sh
git branch
```
- **Purpose:** Shows the list of branches and highlights the active one.
- **Result:** Confirms the branch you're currently on.

---

### **Step 2: Viewing the Commit History**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
- **Purpose:** Displays all commits in a compact format.
- **Result:** Helps identify the commit we want to cherry-pick.

---

### **Step 3: Switching to the Target Branch**
```sh
git switch master
```
- **Purpose:** Moves to the `master` branch (or any other branch where you want to apply the commit).
- **Result:** The working directory now reflects the `master` branch.

---

### **Step 4: Cherry-Picking a Specific Commit**
```sh
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
- **Purpose:** Applies the specific commit from another branch onto the current branch.
- **Result:** A new commit is created **with a different commit ID** but with the same content.

---

### **Step 5: Handling Conflicts (If Any)**
```sh
git status
```
- **Purpose:** Checks if there are merge conflicts.
- **Result:** Displays unmerged paths if conflicts exist.

---

### **Step 6: Resolving Conflicts Manually (If Needed)**
- Open the conflicted file(s) in an editor.
- Manually **edit the conflicts**.
- Stage the resolved files:
  ```sh
  git add <file>
  ```
- Continue cherry-picking after resolving conflicts:
  ```sh
  git cherry-pick --continue
  ```
- **Result:** The commit is successfully applied.

---

### **Step 7: Aborting a Cherry-Pick (If Needed)**
```sh
git cherry-pick --abort
```
- **Purpose:** Cancels the cherry-pick operation.
- **Result:** The repository returns to its previous state.

---

### **Step 8: Checking the Commit History Again**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
- **Purpose:** Verifies that the cherry-picked commit is now part of the `master` branch.
- **Result:** Confirms that only the specific commit was copied.

---

## **Key Differences Between Merge, Rebase, and Cherry-Pick**
| **Operation** | **Effect** | **Use Case** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `git merge` | Combines entire branches, creates a **merge commit** | When you want to combine full branch histories |
| `git rebase` | Moves commits, **rewrites history** | When you want a **cleaner history** (linear) |
| `git cherry-pick` | Copies a **specific commit** to another branch | When you need only **one commit**, not the whole branch |

---

## **Final Summary**
| **Step** | **Command** | **Result** |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Check Current Branch** | `git branch` | Confirms active branch. |
| **View Commit History** | `git log --oneline --graph --all` | Identifies the commit to cherry-pick. |
| **Switch to Target Branch** | `git switch master` | Moves to the branch where the commit should be applied. |
| **Cherry-Pick a Commit** | `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` | Applies the commit as a new commit with a different ID. |
| **Check for Conflicts** | `git status` | Identifies any merge conflicts. |
| **Resolve Conflicts** | Manually edit files, then `git add <file>` | Fixes conflicts and continues cherry-picking. |
| **Continue Cherry-Pick** | `git cherry-pick --continue` | Completes the process after resolving conflicts. |
| **Abort Cherry-Pick (if needed)** | `git cherry-pick --abort` | Cancels the cherry-pick operation. |
| **Check Final Commit History** | `git log --oneline --graph --all` | Verifies that the commit was applied correctly. |

This is how **cherry-picking** works in Git! 🎯  
Let me know if you have any questions. 🚀

### **Cherry-Picking vs. Merging in Git: Command Order, Purpose, and Results**  

---

## **1. Scenario Overview**
We have the following situation:
1. A typo was introduced in **m1.txt** in the `master` branch.
2. A new branch (`feature-2`) was created from `master`, where:
   - A **new folder** and two **new files** were added.
   - The **typo in m1.txt** was fixed.
3. We want to apply **only the typo fix** to `master`, without merging all changes from `feature-2`.  
   - A **merge** would bring everything from `feature-2` to `master`, which we **do not** want.  
   - Instead, we use **cherry-picking** to copy only the commit that fixes the typo.

---

## **2. Order of Commands and Their Effects**

### **Step 1: Checking the Current Branch**
```sh
git branch
```
- **Purpose:** Lists all branches and highlights the current one.
- **Result:** Confirms that we are in the `master` branch.

---

### **Step 2: Modifying the `m1.txt` File in `master`**
```sh
# Open and edit the file to add some text (with a typo)
echo "Some important feature" >> m1.txt
```
- **Purpose:** Adds text with a **typo** in `m1.txt`.
- **Result:** The file contains `"Some important feature"` (with "important" misspelled).

---

### **Step 3: Staging and Committing the Change**
```sh
git add m1.txt
git commit -m "Added text to m1"
```
- **Purpose:** Saves the changes to the repository.
- **Result:** A new commit is created in `master`.

---

### **Step 4: Creating a New Feature Branch**
```sh
git checkout -b feature-2
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a new branch `feature-2` from `master`.
- **Result:** We are now working in `feature-2`.

---

### **Step 5: Creating a New Folder and File**
```sh
mkdir new-feature
touch new-feature/f-new-1.txt
```
- **Purpose:** Creates a new directory and a file in `feature-2`.
- **Result:** The repository now has `new-feature/f-new-1.txt`.

---

### **Step 6: Staging and Committing the New File**
```sh
git add new-feature/f-new-1.txt
git commit -m "Added f-new-1.txt"
```
- **Purpose:** Saves the new file to the repository.
- **Result:** A new commit is added to `feature-2`.

---

### **Step 7: Fixing the Typo in `m1.txt`**
```sh
# Open and correct the typo
echo "Some important feature" > m1.txt  # Fix the typo by adding 'r'
```
- **Purpose:** Fixes the typo in `m1.txt`.
- **Result:** The file is corrected.

---

### **Step 8: Staging and Committing the Typo Fix**
```sh
git add m1.txt
git commit -m "Fixed typo in m1"
```
- **Purpose:** Saves the typo fix to `feature-2`.
- **Result:** A new commit is created with only the typo fix.

---

### **Step 9: Adding Another New File**
```sh
touch new-feature/f-new-2.txt
git add new-feature/f-new-2.txt
git commit -m "Added f-new-2.txt"
```
- **Purpose:** Adds another new file to `feature-2`.
- **Result:** Another new commit is added.

---

### **Step 10: Checking the Commit History**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
- **Purpose:** Shows a compact commit history.
- **Result:** Helps identify the commit that fixes the typo.

---

### **Step 11: Switching Back to `master`**
```sh
git switch master
```
- **Purpose:** Moves back to `master` branch.
- **Result:** We are now working in `master`, which does not yet have the typo fix.

---

### **Step 12: Cherry-Picking the Typo Fix Commit**
```sh
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
- **Purpose:** Applies only the commit that fixes the typo to `master`, without merging all changes from `feature-2`.
- **Result:** A new commit is created in `master` that **only** contains the typo fix.

---

### **Step 13: Checking the Commit History Again**
```sh
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
- **Purpose:** Verifies that the typo fix was added to `master` but **not** the other changes.
- **Result:** The commit history shows that only the typo fix was copied to `master`, while the feature branch still contains the other changes.

---

## **3. Summary of Commands and Their Results**
| **Step** | **Command** | **Purpose** | **Result** |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Check Current Branch** | `git branch` | Verify the active branch | Confirms we are in `master` |
| **Modify `m1.txt`** | Edit file | Add a typo in `m1.txt` | File contains a typo |
| **Commit the Change** | `git add m1.txt` `git commit -m "Added text to m1"` | Save the change | New commit in `master` |
| **Create a New Feature Branch** | `git checkout -b feature-2` | Create `feature-2` from `master` | Switched to `feature-2` |
| **Create a New Folder & File** | `mkdir new-feature` `touch new-feature/f-new-1.txt` | Add new feature files | Files exist in `feature-2` |
| **Commit the New File** | `git add new-feature/f-new-1.txt` `git commit -m "Added f-new-1.txt"` | Save the new file | New commit in `feature-2` |
| **Fix the Typo in `m1.txt`** | Edit file | Correct the typo | Typo is fixed |
| **Commit the Typo Fix** | `git add m1.txt` `git commit -m "Fixed typo in m1"` | Save the typo fix | New commit in `feature-2` |
| **Add Another New File** | `touch new-feature/f-new-2.txt` `git add new-feature/f-new-2.txt` `git commit -m "Added f-new-2.txt"` | Add another new file | Another commit in `feature-2` |
| **Check Commit History** | `git log --oneline --graph --all` | View commit structure | Helps identify the typo fix commit |
| **Switch to `master`** | `git switch master` | Move back to `master` | Ready to cherry-pick |
| **Cherry-Pick the Typo Fix** | `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` | Apply only the typo fix | Typo fix added to `master`, other changes ignored |
| **Check Commit History Again** | `git log --oneline --graph --all` | Verify cherry-picking worked | Confirms the typo fix is now in `master` |

---

## **4. Key Differences: Cherry-Picking vs. Merging**
| **Operation** | **Effect** | **Use Case** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `git merge` | Combines **all** changes from a branch | Use when you want **everything** from another branch |
| `git cherry-pick` | Copies **only one commit** to another branch | Use when you need **just one specific change** |

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Cherry-Picking** allows you to apply a single commit from another branch **without merging everything**.
- It creates a **new commit ID**, meaning there are **duplicate commits** in different branches.
- **Merging** is better when you want **all** changes from a branch.
- **Cherry-Picking is useful for quick bug fixes** without merging unrelated changes.

## **4. Key Differences: Lightweight vs. Annotated Tags**
| **Type** | **Command** | **Contains** | **Use Case** |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Lightweight Tag** | `git tag <tag-name> <commit-hash>` | Just a commit reference | Temporary or internal use |
| **Annotated Tag** | `git tag -a <tag-name> -m "message"` | Commit + tagger info + message | Official versioning |

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Tags help mark milestones** in Git projects.
- **Lightweight tags** are simple pointers to commits.
- **Annotated tags** store additional metadata.
- **Tags make it easy to find and switch** to specific versions.
- **Deleting a tag only removes the reference, not the commit itself**.
