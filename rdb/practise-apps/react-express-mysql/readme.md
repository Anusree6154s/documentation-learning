That sounds like a great project! You could create a **SQL Playground** app where you can try out different SQL concepts interactively. Here are some ideas for features:  

1. **Multi-Table Database** – Include tables for users, products, orders, payments, etc., so you can practice **joins, subqueries, and indexing**.  
2. **CRUD Operations** – Allow users to insert, update, delete, and query data.  
3. **Stored Procedures & Triggers** – Implement stored procedures and triggers to automate tasks.  
4. **Views & Indexing** – Create views and indexed queries to test performance optimization.  
5. **Transaction Management** – Implement commit, rollback, and ACID compliance scenarios.  
6. **User Authentication** – Add login/logout with role-based permissions (admin, user, etc.).  
7. **Query Execution Panel** – A feature where you can write and execute SQL queries dynamically.  
8. **Performance Testing** – Simulate large datasets to analyze query execution time.  

Would you like it to be web-based (like a small SQL IDE) or a local app with a database backend?
